2. **Route Optimization and Efficiency Enhancement**:
   - **Objective**: Streamline bus routes and schedules to reduce operational costs, enhance service quality, and minimize travel duration.
   - **Rationale**: Optimized routes and schedules lead to fuel savings, shorter travel times, and improved passenger satisfaction.
   
3. **Fleet Management and Modernization Assessment**:
   - **Objective**: Utilize data-driven decisions for fleet optimization and evaluate the need for modernizing the bus fleet.
   - **Rationale**: An efficiently managed fleet aligns with demand, minimizing costs, while modernization can improve fuel efficiency and reduce maintenance expenses.

4. **Sustainable Practices and Technologies Integration**:
   - **Objective**: Investigate eco-friendly technologies and practices to minimize environmental impact and fuel costs.
   - **Rationale**: Sustainability initiatives reduce emissions, lower fuel consumption, and enhance the system's environmental footprint.

5. **Enhanced Passenger Experience and Affordability Improvement**:
   - **Objective**: Elevate passenger satisfaction and affordability through promotions, loyalty programs, and integration.
   - **Rationale**: Improving the passenger experience attracts riders, increasing revenue, and ensuring public transit remains an attractive option.
